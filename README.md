## About
Playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons is an entertaining way to spend an evening. Running a game, however, can be an excerise in frustration.
As a Dungeon Master, you are charged with keeping the story going which can be difficult with the abundace of rules, stats and lore needed to run a fun campaign. All this information comes in a varitey of sources, all of which have to be referenced when the need arises. Searching through one of many books to find a obscure role all while trying to maintain the narritive of the the adventure can lead to a pause in the action taking everyone away from the fantasy of the game. With Tome, all that inforamtion is distilled down to a singular source so that a Dungeon Master can spen more time telling the story rather than looking up rules.

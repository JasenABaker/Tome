    intro: "TWO CENTURIES AGO, THE GREAT DWARF
    smith Durgeddin the Black and his clan
    were driven from their home by a horde of
    fierce ores and trolls. They plundered the
    dwarves' ancestral halls and slew all they
    
    could catch. Fleeing his enemies, Durgeddin 
    led the destitute remnants of his clan
    
    in search of a new home. After years of wandering, the
    dwarves discovered a great cavern system beneath the
    Stone Tooth: a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare
    rocky crag. There Durgeddin and his followers founded
    the stronghold of Khundrukar.
    About a century ago, a member of Durgeddin's clan
    was captured by a powerful ore tribe during a raid, and
    the ores learned of their enemy's hidden stronghold.
    The ore chieftains raised a great army and marched
    on Khundrukar. In a hard-fought siege lasting months,
    the ores tunneled around the dwarven defenses. When
    they finally stormed the place, they put all within to the
    sword, then carried off wagonloads of booty.
    In the years since the great battle, various creatures
    have occupied the stronghold and used the place as a
    base for their raids. At other times, the caverns have lain
    
    empty except for the mindless and bloodthirsty monsters 
    that haunt such places. Today legends of Durgeddin's 
    Vengeance (or the Smith's War) and the extraordinary 
    blades the dwarves forged in anger still surface
    
    from time to time in the lands near the Stone Tooth.",
    synopsis:"The Forge of Fury is set in the ruined stronghold of

    Khundrukar. It is designed for four 3rd-level player characters. They can advance to 5th level with good play.
    
    The characters come to the Stone Tooth in search of
    a reputed cache of Durgeddin's superior blades and find
    the stronghold inhabited by dangerous monsters. The
    complex consists of the following five sections:
    The Mountain Door. The Mountain Door comprises the
    uppermost level of the cavern complex. It is currently
    inhabited by a tribe of fierce ores, led by a brutal ogre
    known as Great Ulfe.
    The Glitterhame. The largest level of Khundrukar,
    
    the Glitterhame is an expanse of beautiful natural 
    caverns now infested by troglodytes and other
    
    cave-dwelling monsters.
    The Sinkhole. Streams in the Glitterhame descend to
    an underground river, which runs through a corner of
    the caverns forgotten by the denizens above.
    The Foundry. Beyond the Glitterhame lies a complex
    of chambers and passageways carved by Durgeddin's
    folk. A small band of duergar (gray dwarves) currently
    hold Durgeddin's hall, working to uncover the secrets
    of the smith's ancient forge. A great crevasse drops to
    the Black Lake.
    The Black Lake. The most dangerous denizen of the
caverns under the Stone Tooth lairs in the cold, still
waters of the Black Lake. Nightscale, a young black
dragon, discovered a passage into the lake through
an underwater siphon connecting to a mere on the far
side of the hill. The dragon has claimed the ancient
wealth of Khundrukar as her hoard.",

#     The opening is about 40 feet down, and it lies about
#     100 feet from the western lakeshore. Player characters
#     exploring around the lake can't find this outlet unless
#     they conduct extensive dives to plumb the mere's depths,
#     requiring DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks to swim
#     underwater. If any characters are capable of staying this
#     deep without suffocating and conduct a thorough search
#     of the lake, they discover the passage with a successful
    
#     DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters enter 
#     through this watery passage, they emerge in area 54
    
#     of map 2.6, the Black Lake."

    location:"Wait and Watch",
    intro: "The characters might choose to observe the path for
    some time before braving the Stone Tooth. When they
    arrive, two foraging parties from Great Ulfe's tribe are
    searching the nearby hills for loot. The first party of four
    ores returns two days after the characters arrive, and
    the second group three days after that. These ores sleep
    by day and travel by night, so they arrive in the party's
    vicinity just before dawn.
    If the party sets up camp at least 90 feet from the path
    and doesn't take any action that might draw attention,
    
    the returning ores pass by without spotting the camp-
    site. Otherwise, the ores notice the camp when they come within 90 feet (or within twice as far if a campfire
    is burning or the party isn't attempting to be quiet).
    A lookout whose post overlooks the trail and who has
    a passive Perception score of 10 or higher detects the
    ores as they approach. The ores aren't likely to notice
    a hidden lookout; compare their passive Perception
    scores to the character's Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the ores come across the camp and aren't spotted,
    they attempt to take out anyone on watch or creep into
    the camp to attack sleeping characters.
    
    If an ore party moves past the characters unchal-
    lenged or fights its way through, the survivors reinforce
    
    the defenses in the complex (see area 5 and area 14).
    Captured ores can describe in some detail the general
    arrangement of the Mountain Door. They don't know
    
    anything about the rest of the complex, or that it's pos-
    sible to enter through the chimney. The ores defending
    
    the Mountain Door refuse to negotiate for their return.
    The characters might disguise themselves as ores
    using captured gear. Doing so can let them try to bluff
    their way past sentries in the dungeon, using Charisma
    
    (Deception) checks contested by the ores' Wisdom (In-
    sight) checks.",
